				<h2>Meet Portico</h2>
				<p class="bigger"><strong>Welcome to the home of Portico - the most popular and widely deployed open
				source RTI, designed to support the growth and expansion of the HLA.</strong> </p>

				<p class="bigger">An RTI is the core infrastructure of the HLA - without it, you don't have a
				simulation. Portico was born out of frustration at the lack of a viable, free option to support
				research and development. From its beginnings as a side project of postgrad students at the
				University of Ballarat in Australia, Portico has grown and matured thanks to
				support from its community and through funding from government and commercial partners.</p>

				<p>"If commercial viability is a defacto entry criteria for any technology,

					as opportunity cost over the long term. Whether intentional or not, the
					resulting 'empty nest' effect is the same.
				</p>
				<p>Open and free infrastructure tools support open standards in ways that
					commercial options simply can't. Open Source don't destroy infrastructure

		<!-- Text Section -->
		<div class="two-thirds column">
			<p class="bigger">
			Open standards reduce barriers-to-entry and facilitiate collaboration by giving communities a
			common platform to build on. Open access underpins and <strong>drives innovation</strong>
			by letting users with varied interests and requirements leverage a collective effort to solve
			common problems so that they can focus on the novel and valuable aspects of their work.
			</p>

			<p class="bigger">
			A rising tide lifts all boats, and open infrasturcture standards have been particularly successful
			at letting users focus on the ways they can add value rather than burning time reinventing the wheel.
			Walled Garden Ecosystems underpinned soley by high-cost commercial infrastructure do not
			grow and thrive the way that those also supported by more egalitarian options do.
			</p>

			<p class="bigger">
			Without readily available options for those who don't have the commercial means to buy
			their way into the benefits of open standards, entire groups of contributors are lost. 
			Innovation stagnates without the injection of activity from a larger group with
			differing needs and limitations. Evolution is constrained by the world-view of the
			early drivers while industry quietly and unilaterally moves on.
			</p>

			<p class="bigger">
			Free and open access to support a varied community, from the university lab to production
			environments. This is why Portico exists.

	<h2>Portico History</h2>

	<p class="bigger">Like all good tech-industry stories, Portico starts on a university campus
		with a bunch of restless undergrads. That’s pretty much where the resemblance to Facebook
		ends. Rather than fortune, fame and movies, this group of mugs decided to write an RTI –
		the least sexy of all software, even by the already unattractive standard of infrastructure
		tools. If only we’d limited all attribute reflections to 140 bytes! Sorry – that is a
		truly horrible joke. Despite that handicap, the project has gone on to receive both
		community support and industry funding, growing into something we think is not only useful,
		but an importance presence in the HLA-ecosystem. This is the story of how it came together.</p>

	<!-- Beginnings -->
	<div class="sixteen columns" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
		<h3>Beginnings (2005-2006)</h3>
		<img src="../assets/images/logos/jarti-logo.jpg" style="float:right;width:100px;"
			alt="Logo from the original project identity - jaRTI"/>
		<p class="smaller">Portico began as a side project for its two founders during their time as
			students in the University of Ballarat's Distributed Simulation Lab.
			Frustrated by the lack of an affordable cross-platform RTI that could be used to support
			their research projects, in late 2005 they began writing their own.</p>

		<p class="smaller">The project was initially named jaRTI, and after a considerable amount of
			internal development the first public release was launched during the Australian
			<a href="www.simtect.com.au">SimTecT</a> conference in June of 2006. It initially provided
			support for the core data exchange services of the HLA v1.3 interface and provided only a
			Java API.</p>

	</div>

	<hr style="margin-bottom:20px;"></hr>

	<!-- Funding -->
	<div class="eight columns">
		<h3>Funding (2006-2009)</h3>
		<p class="smaller">Following its initial release, jaRTI development continued to advance,
			with additional features, services and tools being added over the next year. Further
			development assistance was added to the project through Lance Burns, another UoB student.</p>

		<p class="smaller">The project was well received and through its initial year it was downloaded
			more than 1,300 times. As interest grew, the team put in place a more professional and
			structured approach in order to maintain long-term grown of the project.</p>

		<p class="smaller">Additional community support services were added through mailing lists and
			forums, and formal contribution policies were drafted. A significant effort was undertaken
			to document the software architecture and API, and a continuous integration environment
			was deployed.</p>

		<p class="smaller">As part of this process an image change was deemed necessary, and in
			May 2007 the Portico Project was founded. To help these transition activities, Portico
			received formal funding from the then Australian Defence Simulation Office (ADSO) which
			is now part of the Australian Defence Simulation and Training Centre (ADSTC). This work
			was carried out under contract with <a href="http://www.calytrix.com">Calytrix Technologies</a>.</p>

		<p class="smaller">Further work was undertaken to expand the supported HLA services and a C++
			interface. Subsequent funding was provided by ADSO to perform various updates to the
			infrastructure and integrate Portico into the Defence Synthetic Environment (DSE) as a 
			supported HLA RTI option.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="eight columns" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
		<p class="smaller">Through the DSE, ADSO wished to deliver the concept of "Training-in-a-Box",
			comprising of a common set of simulation applications, pre-validated and configured to
			operate together, thus reducing the overall burden required to deploy and maintain.
			Integrating a commercial RTI to support the HLA profile gave rise to significant and
			costly licensing problems during distribution. Able to be freely distributed, Portico was
			funded to overcome these issues.</p>

		<p class="smaller">At the conclusion of these activities Portico had implemented the major
			HLA v1.3 services commonly used to support Live, Virtual and Constructive training tools,
			and included interfaces for:</p>

		<ul class="list check-list">
			<li>Java HLA v1.3</li>
			<li>Java SISO-STD-004-2004 DLC v1.3</li>
			<li>C++ HLA v1.3</li>
			<li>C++ SISO-STD-004-2004 DLC v1.3 (link this up)</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="smaller">Portico was integrated into the DSE as the default RTI option for the
			<em>Training-in-a-Box</em> and <em>Experimentation-in-a-Box</em> packages.</p>

		<p class="smaller">Portico v1.0 was released on the 27th of May, 2009. It included a
			significant rearchitecture of the communications framework, changing the RTI to operate in
			a peer-to-peer mode and yielding vastly improved performance. ADSO continued support of
			the project and funded a performance analysis of the new and old versions of Portico
			compared to the defacto HLA v1.3 standard RTI-NG implementation
			<a href="../about/performance">which can be found here</a>.</p>
	</div>

	<hr style="margin-bottom:20px;"></hr>

	<!-- Expansion -->
	<div class="eight columns">
		<h3>Expansion (2009-2012)</h3>

		<p class="smaller">Following the release of Portico v1.0, interest turned to the IEEE-1516
			standard. An initial implementation of the Java interface was put in place, supporting
			the base services of theIEEE-1516 standard and the SISO Dynamic Link Compatibility 
			standard:</p>

		<ul class="list check-list">
			<li>Java <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/1516-2000.html">IEEE 1516.1-2000</a></li>
  			<li>Java <a href="http://www.sisostds.org/DigitalLibrary.aspx?Command=Core_Download&EntryId=30828">SISO-STD-004.1-2004</a></li>
  		</ul>

		<p class="smaller">Over this period, Portico deployment numbers rose significatly. It surpassed
			10,000 downloads in September 2011, with users accessing it from over 40 countries. Portico
			was being used to assist teaching within universities as well as supporting reserach
			project that leveraged the HLA. It is commonly used in projects and experiments that are
			published through conferences and journals. It is being used to support training and
			experimentation activities and as a low-cost capability development tool - postponing the
			purchase of expensive commercial RTI licenses until they are absolutely required.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="eight columns">

		<p class="smaller">During this time Portico's lead developer, Dr. Tim Pokorny became the CTO
			of the Australian simulation and training company,
			<a href="http://www.calytrix.com">Calytrix Technologies</a>. Michael Fraser, the other half
			of Portico's core development team was also hired into the company and is currently a
			Senior Software Engineer. Through their involvement with Portico, Calytrix have continued
			to support development and provided dedicated time for employees to contribute. Calytrix
			have also ensured compatibility of their product lines with Portico, advocating its
			continued adoption.</p>

	</div>

	<hr style="margin-bottom:20px;"></hr>

	<!-- Expansion -->
	<div class="eight columns">
		<h3>HLA Evolved (2012-Present)</h3>

		<p class="smaller">In early 2012 Portico received additional funding from
			<a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en">Thales</a> to put in place the first
			incarnation of the recently ratified IEEE 1516-2010 standard: "HLA Evolved". Under 
			this project, the core information exchange services were developed and key parts of
			the updated specification (such as modular FOM support) were added.</p>

		<ul class="list check-list">
			<li>Java <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/1516-2010.html">IEEE 1516.1-2010</a></li>
			<li>C++ <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/1516-2010.html">IEEE 1516.1-2010</a></li>
  		</ul>

		<p class="smaller">Portico v2.0 was released on April 1st, 2013 and now had baseline
			support for all major interations of the HLA standards as well as broad compiler and
			cross-platform support.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="eight columns">

		<p class="smaller">To this day almost 15,000 copies of the software have been downloaded
			over its lifetime, reaching users in over 60 countries. The core Portico repository
			weighs in at over 200,000 lines of code in a mix of Java, C and C++, and has received
			contributions from 11 different developers (a number we hope to grow!).</p>
