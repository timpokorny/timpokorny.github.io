    Welcome to Portico! Grab a drink and settle in, we're about to walk you through everything
    you need to know to install Portico and get an example federation up and running. By the
    end of this you'll have built up enough confidence to go forth and break many things!

Getting Started
===============

This is the Portico _Getting Started_ Guide, it will walk you through *everything* you could
possibly need to know for things 'n stuff, including:

  * How to win friends and influence people
  * How to score with chicks
  * How to do other awesome stuff.

So strap yourself in and let's get started!

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

See Some Code
=============

```java
public static void main( String[] args )
{
	System.out.println( "Do you like Portico?" );
	for( int i = 0; i < 10; i++ )
	{
		String temp = "Yes I do!";
		System.out.println( temp );
	}
}
```

This is some more text that contains `someInlineCode()` for your consideration.

Now we'll try for some embedded HTML code with the <span class="code">doSomethingInteresting()</span> method.

Awesome! Finally, we'll let you bring in code from an external file:

<!-- Bring in some code from an external file -->
<pre data-src="myfile.js" class="language-java"></pre>

Quotes
------
For when you can't figure out how to say it better than someone else, use a quote:

 > Shit just got real<br/>
 > Really real
 >
 >  -- Some person, some place


That's all for now!
