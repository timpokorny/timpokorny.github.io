<p class="bigger">
	<span class="dropcap">T</span>hales Group have been generous to Portico over the years.
	It was with their help that we previously undertook the major activity of adding both
	Java and C++ IEEE-1516e (HLA Evolved) interfaces. With the release of Portico v2.1.0 they
	have once again helped us launch another key capability: the ability to link federates across
	a <b>wide-area network</b>.
</p>

In this release we debut Portico's new WAN features. Federations can now be created from
federates that are running on entirely separate networks, whether that be across a campus,
across a continent or across the globe. Single federates or clusters of federates can be
woven together to create a single, unified federation without needing to resort to complex
VPN infrastructure or other secondary solutions.

These native capabilities help federation operators make better use of distributed resources
that cannot be moved for practical, physical or security reasons. The new capabilities also
focus on cloud-enabling Portico federations.

Cloud infrastructure is becoming more and more popular, and is a key focus of the next
generation of simulation frameworks. To ensure compatibility, these new features have been
tested with Java and C++ federates running across the Digital Ocean, Microsoft Azure and
Amazon Web Services platforms.
